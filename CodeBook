### Variables (referred to by the originators as "features")

All the measure variables in the file SamsungFitnessMeans.txt are means of the features in the original data.
The means are derived by averaging observations of a single test subject for a specific activity.

The activities are labelled consistently with the original data:
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

The means bear the same names as the original features; there was no reason to alter them, as they were meaningful
and concise. The only alteration was the elimination of erroneous repetition
